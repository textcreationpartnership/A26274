         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>IN the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> He is the Miniſter of the true Tabernacle, for the Son of Man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, he is the Miniſter as we have received him, ſo he miniſters in us and by us, and without him we can do nothing acceptable to God; if any miniſter of himſelf or of his own Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he miniſters to ſelf in another, and feeds that which is for Death, both in himſelf and others: all that take upon them to be Miniſters of the Word, muſt be ſure the Miniſter be in his Temple, elſe his Miniſtry will not profit, but will redound back again upon him as unſavory, for that is not the Milk
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45197:2"/>of the Word, it being bitter and not ſweet, ſo the Children cannot receive it; all are to know the Word abiding in them, that it may miniſter at all times, none are to take the <hi>Words</hi> Place upon them, to be called a Miniſter of the Word, or Miniſter of the Truth, but as the Word of Truth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters through us, we being but as the Trumpet, he gives the ſound. This Miniſtry is received in ſeveral Diſpenſations before the Miniſter come into his Temple with a Fan in his hand, and thoſe that receive them there are lyable to miſcarry, being in the Servants State, not being faithful as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (as <hi>Moſes</hi> was) neither Good Stewards over the Lords Money, but ſpend it upon their Luſt or ſelfiſh Part, as it is written, <hi>They took my Jewels and decked themſelves, and played the Harlot.</hi> And ſuch cannot agree among themſelveves, a Lordly Spirit bearing rule in them, they ſmite one another, and would all be Lords, contrary to Chriſts Saying, <hi>He that would be greatest must be your Servant.</hi> But ſome of theſe are ready to ſay, <hi>We are Sons.</hi> If they be, 'tis but of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Leah;</hi> they muſt not inherit with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Son of the <hi>Freewoman,</hi> but muſt be caſt out with Bag and Bottle, that they may know themſelves, and their eyes may be opened to ſee the <hi>Well</hi> which is ſo near them, but did not know it; the Son abides in the Houſe for ever, being the Fathers Heir, though he diffets nothing from a Servant in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice while he is in his Non-Age, being under Tutors, he being brought forth under the Law, fulfilleth the Law, and is the end of the Prophets, and is preferred before <hi>John,</hi> for he was before him, ſo he ends the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with Water, having fulfilled all Righteouſneſs; then he Baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire, and finiſheth that Work, which they could not do which went before him; then the New Heaven and the New Earth is known, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs.

The Effects of theſe things have been and are very ſad, for all Power in Heaven and Earth is given to the Son, and the Woman hath not Power over her own Body: Neither <hi>doth the True Church challenge any ſuch thing,</hi> nor make any ſtir about it, but reſts in the Boſme of her Beloved, and is in ſubjection to Chriſt the Head of the Body the Church.

               <p>COnformity is an eaſie way, there is no Croſs to be taken up in it, Self and Fleſh ſets it up, and Self and Fleſh Conforms to it, the Seed Chriſt cannot. He is without Form, <hi>He hath appeared in ſeveral Forms, but tyed to none.</hi> If any admire the Form that he hath appeared in, he forſakes that Form and leaves it deſolate. Several Examples I have ſeen in my Age, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral I could produce if required, the <hi>Form</hi> is but the <hi>Grave Cloaths</hi> that the Crucified is wrapt in, when the Life is ſlain; but when the Reſurrection is known the <hi>Grave Cloaths are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</hi> Bleſſed and happy are they who have part in the firſt Reſurrection, they contend not about Forms, but ſit together in Heavenly Places above Forms in Chriſt Jeſus. The Pope and Prelates require Conformity, and force to it, and ſo do others according to what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they have, but all is from a wrong ground: none is to force another to do as he doth, or they do, but all are to wait in the Light to feel in themſelves what to do, and as they act in obedience thereto, acceptance with the Lord is witneſſed and enjoyed.</p>
               <p>Conformity is a broad way, it ſerves for a Covering to Hippocrites, and will ſalve over (cover or excuſe) any thing in its Members, but will repreſent others as Monſters: the <hi>Conteſt</hi> hath been between <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Form, but now it's</hi> among <hi>ſome</hi> between <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Freedom:</hi> now with ſome, no <hi>Conformity</hi> to <hi>Form,</hi> no <hi>
